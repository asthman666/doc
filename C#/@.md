### [Verbatim string literals](http://csharpindepth.com/Articles/General/Strings.aspx)

* To obtain a " within the string itself, you need to write "".

For Example:

    Regular literal     Verbatim literal    Resulting string
    "Hello"             @"Hello"	        Hello
    "Backslash: \\"     @"Backslash: \"     Backslash: \
    "Quote: \""         @"Quote: """        Quote: "
    "CRLF:\r\nPost"     @"CRLF:             CRLF:
                        Post"               POST

    // Turning a single quote into an escaped single quote within a string
    s = s.Replace("'", @"\'");

### [Verbatim identifier](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/language-specification/lexical-structure#identifiers)

* The "@" character is allowed as a prefix to enable keywords to be used as identifiers.

* The prefix "@" enables the use of keywords as identifiers, which is useful when interfacing with other programming languages. The character @ is not actually part of the identifier, so the identifier might be seen in other languages as a normal identifier, without the prefix.

* Use of the @ prefix for identifiers that are not keywords is permitted, but strongly discouraged as a matter of style.
