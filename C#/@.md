### [Verbatim string literals](http://csharpindepth.com/Articles/General/Strings.aspx)

* To obtain a " within the string itself, you need to write "".

For Example:

<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Regular literal</th>
            <th>Verbatim literal</th>
            <th>Resulting string</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>"Hello"</td>
            <td>@"Hello"</td>
            <td>Hello</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>"Backslash: \\"</td>
            <td>@"Backslash: \"</td>
            <td>Backslash: \</td>                        
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>"Quote: \""</td>
            <td>@"Quote: """</td>
            <td>Quote: "</td>            
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>"CRLF:\r\nPost"</td>
            <td>@"CRLF:<br>
            Post"
            </td>
            <td>CRLF:<br>
            Post
            </td>            
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

    // Turning a single quote into an escaped single quote within a string
    s = s.Replace("'", @"\'");

### [Verbatim identifier](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/language-specification/lexical-structure#identifiers)

* The "@" character is allowed as a prefix to enable keywords to be used as identifiers.

* The prefix "@" enables the use of keywords as identifiers, which is useful when interfacing with other programming languages. The character @ is not actually part of the identifier, so the identifier might be seen in other languages as a normal identifier, without the prefix.

* Use of the @ prefix for identifiers that are not keywords is permitted, but strongly discouraged as a matter of style.
